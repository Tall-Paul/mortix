crypto-lib [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/whiteout-io/crypto-lib.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/whiteout-io/crypto-lib)
==========

A high level crypto module for node.js and the browser. This library exposes a basic high level api, which combines the following low level operations:

* UTF-8 plaintext encoding
* item-key generation
* initialization-vector generation
* AES-CBC item encryption
* Base64 ciphertext encoding
* RSA item-key encryption
* SHA-256 hashing RSA signing of all items

**[Checkout the Demo](http://whiteout-io.github.io/crypto-lib/test/index.html)**


## Getting started - Node.js

### Install and Test

	npm install https://github.com/whiteout-io/crypto-lib/tarball/master
	cd node_modules/crypto-lib/
	npm test

### Example Code

	var lib = require('crypto-lib');

	// generate keypair
	lib.rsa.generateKeypair(1024, function(err, keypair) {

		var publicKey = {
				_id: keypair._id,
				publicKey: keypair.pubkeyPem
			},
			privateKey = {
				_id: keypair._id,
				privateKey: keypair.privkeyPem
			};

		// package into batchable envelope for encryption
		var envelopes = [{
			id: lib.util.UUID(),
			plaintext: 'Hello, World!',
			key: lib.util.random(128),
			iv: lib.util.random(128),
			receiverPk: publicKey._id
		}];

		// encrypt and sign using AES and RSA
		var encryptedList = lib.cryptoBatch.encryptListForUser(envelopes, [publicKey], privateKey);

		// decrypt and verify using AES and RSA
		var decryptedList = lib.cryptoBatch.decryptListForUser(encryptedList, [publicKey], privateKey);

	});


## Getting started - HTML5:

* To get started, check out the mocha browser tests. There is currently no require.js build for the client yet so you'll have to include the individual scripts by hands.
* Has been tested to work on iOS, Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Internet Explorer 10.
* For browsers that don't support window.crypto.getRandomValues(), forge's fortuna algorithm is used to generate pseudo random numbers.
* The crypto operations should be done inside of a Web Worker thread to not block the main UI thread.
* [This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WljJ5guzcLs&feature=share&list=PLBNz3Grrh0qUDwpT0G_1zt9n_uOuan920) also gives some good pointers on how to secure your HTML5 app using Content Security Policy (CSP), sandboxed iframes and CORS in order to protect against XSS and other attacks.
